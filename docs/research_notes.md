# Research Notes (Simulated PM Interviews)

## Alex — Senior PM (SaaS)
- Frustrations: laggy dashboards, metric drift, carryover blindness, too many charts, attribution gaps, manual reporting.
- Current tracking: Jira + Sheets export, mid-sprint checks, Friday summary, normalize labels, extra defect SQL.

## Priya — PMO Lead (Enterprise IT)
- Frustrations: cross-team inconsistency, velocity with no context, unreliable history, manual exec decks.
- Current tracking: Jira → Excel, weekly predictability packet, Confluence roll-up, trusts velocity + carryover after cross-checks.

## Miguel — Product Owner (Startup AI)
- Frustrations: misleading burndown, vanity charts, bugs vs features trade-off hidden.
- Current tracking: stand-up whiteboard, Jira → Sheets, carryover is most trusted, light throughput trend.

## Sarah — Program Manager (Fintech)
- Frustrations: no early risk signals, inconsistent labels, execs ignore non-business metrics, cycle time skew.
- Current tracking: bi-weekly review, Tableau on exports, trusts defect ratio + velocity variance, adds qualitative notes.
